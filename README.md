## 🔑 Key Insights & Findings

Through exploratory data analysis, several key insights were uncovered:

* **Branch Performance:** Branch C generates the highest gross income, indicating higher-value purchases or better margins, despite Branch A having the most transactions.
* **Peak Hours:** The busiest shopping period is in the early afternoon (12 PM - 3 PM), suggesting that staffing and promotions should be focused on this window.
* **Popular Product Lines:** "Fashion accessories" and "Food and beverages" are the most frequently sold product lines, making them crucial for driving foot traffic.
* **Payment Methods:** E-wallet is the most popular payment method, highlighting a trend towards digital payments among customers.
